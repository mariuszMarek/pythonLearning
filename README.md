WIP
The program is part of a bigger project. 
Currently there are classes for recording clikc + keyboard stroak + making screenshots of the active window before the click
In progress there is image comparison with saved screenshots and new ones before there will be a "click"
The goal is to create a GUI version that will allow to automate taska easliy and without any proper programing skill (or at least some basic skills).
